# rst-tutorial
A collection of RST exercises, meant to be completed in the GitHub UI.

## Instructions

For each exercise, click into the named folder (start with "Exercise 1").

First, look at the file titled "Match This Output.png". This is a picture of
the output you're looking to generate with some RST!

Next, open the Exercise file and edit it (see the [Edit a File instructions here](https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/documentors/how-tos/update_a_doc_via_github.html)
if you need help with this step). Use the Preview tab to ensure your output matches
the "Match This Output.png" screenshot.

Once it matches, no need to commit or issue a pull request. If you'd like to see
how we solved the exercise, you can look at the "answer.rst" file.
