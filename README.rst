############

A collection of RST exercises, meant to be completed in the GitHub UI.

Instructions
************

For each exercise, click into the named folder (start with "Exercise 1").

First, look at the file titled ``Match_This_Output.png``. This is a picture of
the output you're looking to generate with some RST!

Next, click on the Exercise file and click on the pencil icon on the top right of
the file to edit it. You'll be taken to a text editor where you can add and remove
text. Try answering the problem by typing RST text into this box.


Use the `Preview tab <https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/documentors/quickstarts/first_documentation_pr.html#preview-your-changes>`_
to ensure your output matches the ``Match_This_Output.png`` screenshot.

Once it matches, no need to commit or issue a pull request. If you'd like to see
how we solved the exercise, you can look at the "answer.rst" file. Click the ``Raw``
button to see how we wrote the RST.
